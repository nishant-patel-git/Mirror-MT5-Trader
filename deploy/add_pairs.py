"""Put this month's contracts onto a machine that is already set up.

The roll list lives in `pairs.json`, which whoever maintains this edits
when the contract months change. The trader double-clicks ADD-PAIRS.BAT
and the new ladders appear on their Exchanges page.

It only ever ADDS. That is the whole design:

  * a pair already in the config is REPORTED and LEFT ALONE - not
    re-written, not re-enabled, not re-stamped. A trader may be holding
    a position on it, and editing the pair under a live position moves
    the ladder out from under the money;
  * nothing is ever deleted or disabled;
  * accounts are never touched at all.

So the worst a wrong roll list can do is add a pair nobody wanted,
which is visible on the screen and removable in one click. It cannot
take away a pair somebody is trading.
