    Build MT5-golden.zip - the MetaTrader 5 folder every office PC gets
    two copies of.

    You run this ONCE, and again whenever the broker ships a new
    terminal build. SETUP.bat then unpacks the result twice on every PC,
    which is faster than running the installer twice and - the part that
    matters - identical every time. No installer dialogs, no 'did I tick
    the same boxes on both'.

    PREPARE THE SOURCE, and it is three steps, not ten:

      1. Install MetaTrader 5 once with the BROKER'S installer
         (mentomarkets5setup.exe), into its own folder such as C:\MT5-A.
      2. Do NOT log in. Cancel the Open an Account dialog if it appears.
      3. Close the terminal.

    That is all. Everything a previous version of this script fussed
    over - the servers list, Market Watch, closing charts, turning News
    off, Allow Algo Trading - lives in
    %APPDATA%\MetaQuotes\Terminal\<hash>\, NOT in the program folder, so
    none of it is in this zip and none of it can be prepared here.

    Two things follow from that, and both were measured on a clean PC:

      * The broker's installer already knows its own servers, so a copy
        of the program folder logs in from
        mt5.initialize(path, login, password, server) with no manual
        sign-in at all. That is the whole reason this approach works.

      * Allow Algo Trading does NOT travel. It is a per-installation
        setting in AppData, so it is pressed once in each terminal the
        first time it opens. SETUP says so at the end.

    Do not reach for /portable to pull those settings into the program
    folder: a terminal started portable refuses IPC from a normally
    started Python, so the legs would never connect. mt5_errors.py
    already records that.

        .\deploy\make-golden-terminal.ps1 -Source 'C:\MT5-A'

    Plain ASCII and single quotes throughout: Windows PowerShell 5.1
    reads a script with no byte-order mark as ANSI, and one curly quote
    from a word processor comes back as a parser error on a line that
    looks perfectly fine.
