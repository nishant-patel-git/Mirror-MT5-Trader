@echo off
REM  MT5-Trader - put a new version on this PC.
REM
REM  Run BY WHOEVER MAINTAINS IT, deliberately, on the machine being
REM  updated. NEXUS Terminal does not do this: a desk's version changes
REM  when somebody decides it changes, not because a commit landed
REM  overnight.
REM
REM  The order matters. The new code is fetched, the tests are run ON
REM  IT, and only if they pass does the update stand. A version that
REM  fails its own tests is put back before anyone can trade on it -
REM  which is the whole reason this is a script and not two git
REM  commands typed from memory.
REM
REM    deploy\UPDATE.BAT              go to the latest on this branch
REM    deploy\UPDATE.BAT --rollback   go back to the version before it
REM
REM  Plain ASCII on purpose: a console running the default code page
REM  turns anything else into mojibake in the one message that matters.

REM --- The engine must not be running -----------------------------------
REM  Swapping files under a live engine is how a half-old, half-new
REM  process ends up holding positions.
REM
REM  Written with a goto rather than a parenthesised block on purpose:
REM  %GOON% inside the block it is SET in expands to what it held when
REM  the block was parsed - nothing - so the answer would be ignored and
REM  the update would always abort. Delayed expansion would also fix it;
REM  a label is harder to get wrong six months from now.

REM --- Python and Git ---------------------------------------------------
REM  FOUR ways a working Python turns up on these boxes, and all four
REM  are normal.
REM
REM  The launcher by exact version first: py -3.11 on a machine that
REM  also has 3.9 on PATH is the good outcome, and looking at PATH
REM  first would miss it. Then 3.14, which rollout.json also allows and
REM  the suite has passed on - asking only for 3.11 told a perfectly
REM  good 3.14 desk it had no Python at all. Then py -3 for a version
REM  nobody listed here. Then plain "python", which is what a conda or
REM  venv prompt has and a python.org install without the launcher.
REM
REM  A test with NO assert in it, deliberately. "python" on a bare
REM  Windows is the Microsoft Store stub, which exits non-zero without
REM  running anything, so a plain import is enough to tell a real
REM  interpreter from the stub - and what version it is gets decided
REM  below, where it can be SAID rather than hidden in an exit code.

REM --- Is it a Python this can actually trade through? ------------------
REM  32-BIT IS FATAL. MetaTrader5's IPC handshake fails against a 32-bit
REM  Python with an error that says nothing, and the symptom on the desk
REM  is a leg that reads unknown forever. Starting would be worse than
REM  refusing, because it looks like it worked.
REM
REM  AN UNTESTED VERSION IS A WARNING, not a refusal. It may well be
REM  fine, the safety tests are the real gate, and stopping a trader at
REM  9am over a version number the suite then passes would be the wrong
REM  trade-off.
REM
REM  chr(80) is "P" - there is no quote character inside the quoted
REM  argument, because cmd would end the argument on it.
%PY% -c "import struct,sys;sys.exit(0 if struct.calcsize(chr(80))*8==64 else 1)" >nul 2>&1

  echo.
  echo       MetaTrader 5 will not talk to it: the handshake fails with
  echo       an error that says nothing, and the leg simply never
  echo       connects. Install Python 3.11 64-bit from python.org and
  echo       run this again.

REM --- Where we are now, so we can come back ---------------------------
REM  Recorded BEFORE anything moves. A rollback that has to work out
REM  where it was going is a rollback that cannot run when it is needed.
set "WAS="
for /f %%h in ('git rev-parse HEAD 2^>nul') do set "WAS=%%h"
if defined WAS goto :know_where_we_are

REM  TWO DIFFERENT FAULTS, and this used to blame the wrong one.
REM
REM  git rev-parse can come back empty because there is no clone here -
REM  a folder somebody unzipped instead of installing - or because git
REM  CAN SEE the clone and is refusing to touch it. Saying 'not a git
REM  clone' for both sent an operator off to reinstall a machine whose
REM  clone was perfectly fine.
REM
REM  The refusal that actually happens on these PCs is dubious
REM  ownership. SETUP asks for Administrator and clones as that
REM  account; UPDATE is double-clicked as the trader. When those are
REM  different accounts git refuses the repository outright, and its
REM  complaint went to the 2>nul above, so nobody ever saw it.
if not exist ".git" (
  echo   [X] There is no .git folder here, so this is not a clone -
  echo       it is a copy of the files. UPDATE works by fetching, so
  echo       there is nothing for it to fetch into.
  echo.
  echo       Re-run deploy\SETUP.bat, or clone over it. config.json
  echo       and .env are NOT in the repository, so copy those two
  echo       aside first and put them back afterwards.
  echo.
  pause
  exit /b 1
)
echo   [X] There IS a clone here, but git will not read it. Its own
echo       words:
echo.
git rev-parse HEAD
echo.
echo       If that mentions "dubious ownership", the clone was made by
echo       a different Windows account - SETUP runs as Administrator,
echo       this does not. Fix it once, in a Command Prompt opened AS
echo       ADMINISTRATOR:
echo.
echo           git config --system --add safe.directory C:/MT5-Trader
echo.
echo       Then run this again. Nothing has been changed.
