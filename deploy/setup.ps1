<#
    MT5-Trader: turn a bare Windows PC into a trading box.

    Launched by SETUP.bat, which has already asked for Administrator.
    Run it directly only if you know why:

        Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force
        .\deploy\setup.ps1 -RepoUrl https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git

    The order is deliberate. Everything that can fail cheaply fails
    FIRST: the golden zip is checked before Git is downloaded, and the
    tests run before the trader is asked for a single password. A setup
    that is going to fail should fail in the first minute, in front of
    whoever started it - not at 9am the next morning.

    Plain ASCII and single quotes throughout, for the reason bootstrap.ps1
    gives: Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a script with no byte-order mark
    as ANSI, and one curly quote from a word processor comes back as a
    parser error on a line that looks perfectly fine.

    THE HOST THIS IS ABOUT TO RUN ON, made safe before anything else.

    Four settings, and every one of them is a bare-PC failure somebody
    else has already had.

    TLS. Windows PowerShell 5.1 on Windows 10 negotiates whatever
    .NET's default is, and on a machine that has not had its .NET
    defaults changed that can still be TLS 1.0/1.1. python.org and
    github.com both refuse those now, so the download dies with
    'Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel' - a message that says
    nothing about Python and sends the installer hunting for a
    firewall. Named protocols are OR-ed in rather than assigned, so a
    host that already has TLS 1.3 keeps it.

    THE PROGRESS BAR. Invoke-WebRequest renders one by default, and in
    5.1 that rewrite costs more time than the download: a 25 MB
    installer can take minutes instead of seconds. Off.

    NATIVE COMMANDS IN POWERSHELL 7.4+. There, a native program's
    non-zero exit code becomes a TERMINATING error whenever
    $ErrorActionPreference is 'Stop'. This script deliberately reads
    exit codes and decides - a failed login is a warning, a
    non-fast-forward is a warning, a cancelled wizard is a warning -
    and under 7.4 the first of them would kill the install instead.
    SETUP.bat starts Windows PowerShell, where this does not arise, so
    this line is for the day somebody runs the script by hand.

    THE PROXY. An office PC behind an authenticating proxy needs the
    signed-in user's credentials to fetch anything at all.

Step 'Python'

function Test-Python {
    <#
        Is this interpreter one this project can actually run on?

        Two things are checked and NEITHER is negotiable:

        64-BIT. MetaTrader5's IPC handshake fails against a 32-bit
        Python with an error that says nothing useful, and the symptom
        on the desk is a leg that never connects.

        THE VERSION. The suite is tested on 3.11. A machine carrying
        the company's Python 3.9, or a 3.13 that no wheel exists for
        yet, must be told so - not quietly used, which turns one PC
        into the one that behaves differently.
    #>
    param([string[]] $Command)
    <#
        NO DOUBLE QUOTE ANYWHERE IN THIS PROBE, and that is not a
        style choice.

        Windows PowerShell 5.1 - which is what SETUP.bat starts, and
        what every one of these office PCs has - rebuilds the command
        line for a native program by wrapping any argument containing a
        space in double quotes, and it does NOT escape the double
        quotes already inside it. So the old probe,

            'import sys, struct; print("%d.%d %d" % (...))'

        reached python.exe as

            -c "import sys, struct; print(%d.%d %d" % (...))"

        which Windows then split at those quotes into several
        arguments. Python got a fragment, raised SyntaxError, exited
        non-zero, and its complaint went to the stderr this function
        deliberately swallows. Test-Python therefore returned $null for
        a PERFECTLY GOOD Python 3.11 - on every machine, every time.

        That is the whole bug behind 'Python installed but this window
        still cannot find it': the interpreter was found, run, and then
        judged missing because it could not parse a mangled one-liner.
        Installing Python again could never fix it.

        Written with no quote character anywhere in it, the argument
        survives whatever quoting a host puts around it, so 5.1, 7.x
        and cmd.exe all deliver it whole. chr(80) is 'P'; three numbers
        come back separated by spaces - major, minor, bits - and the
        version is put back together on this side.
    #>
    $probe = 'import sys,struct;print(sys.version_info[0],sys.version_info[1],struct.calcsize(chr(80))*8)'
    <#
        Run it with errors NOT fatal, and swallow stderr.

        A fresh Windows ships zero-byte python.exe and python3.exe
        stubs in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps that open the
        Microsoft Store. Running one prints "Python was not found; run
        without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store" to
        STDERR - and PowerShell 7 turns a native command's stderr into
        a TERMINATING error while $ErrorActionPreference is 'Stop'.

        So on a genuinely bare PC this probe killed the whole install
        at the exact moment it had established that Python was missing
        and was about to go and install it.
    #>
    $out = $null
    $previous = $ErrorActionPreference
    try {
        $ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'
        $out = Invoke-Python $Command @('-c', $probe) 2>$null
    } catch {
        return $null
    } finally {
        $ErrorActionPreference = $previous
    }
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0 -or -not $out) { return $null }
    <#
        THE LAST LINE, and it must be three plain numbers.

        Two things were wrong with reading this as 'whatever came back,
        split on spaces'.

        A wrapper gets to speak first. Plenty of things that answer to
        'python' on an office PC are not python.exe - a shim, a
        launcher, an antivirus or endpoint agent wrapping the
        executable - and they print a line of their own before the
        program runs. One PC answered with a line beginning
        'Extracting:', and the version came out as that word.

        And the cast was outside the try. [int] on a word is a
        TERMINATING error, so instead of 'this is not a Python I can
        use', the whole install died on the spot with a .NET conversion
        message and nothing about Python in it.

        So: take the last non-empty line, and accept it only if it is
        exactly three integers. Anything else is not an interpreter
        this script can trust - it is SAID, so the next person sees
        what the machine actually answered, and looking continues
        elsewhere.
