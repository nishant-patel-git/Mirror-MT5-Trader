"""What START TRADING checks before it starts anything.

It exists because the batch file cannot read `config.json`, and the one
question that decides whether a start can work is IN that file: does
each account name its own terminal?

    terminal_path SET   MT5 launches that terminal and logs it in
                        (`mt5.initialize(path=..., login=...)`), so the
                        trader does not open MetaTrader 5 at all.
    terminal_path BLANK the runner attaches to whatever terminal is
                        already open, so one must be - and a refusal
                        here is right.

The old check refused whenever no `terminal64.exe` was running. On a
configured machine that is a refusal to start something that would have
worked, which on a trading desk at 9am is the expensive kind of wrong.

Exit codes, for the batch file:
    0  go
    1  stop, and the reason is on stdout in words
