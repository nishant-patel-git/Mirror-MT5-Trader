    Prepares a Windows EC2 instance to run MT5-Trader.

    Run once, in PowerShell, from the folder you cloned into:

        Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force
        .\deploy\bootstrap.ps1

    This file is deliberately plain ASCII and single-quoted throughout.
    Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a script that has no byte-order mark as
    ANSI, so one stray dash or quote from a word processor comes back as
    a parser error on a line that looks perfectly fine - which is a
    miserable way to lose an afternoon on a box that is otherwise ready.

    What it does NOT do, on purpose: install MetaTrader 5 or log it in.
    Each account needs its own terminal installation and its own login,
    and choosing which account goes where is the one decision that must
    not be automated - two accounts pointing at one terminal folder are
    one account whatever the config says.

        Three ways a working Python turns up on these boxes, and all
        three are normal:
          * the launcher, 'py -3.11', on a plain python.org install;
          * 'python' on PATH, which is what a conda or venv prompt has;
          * neither, on a fresh instance, which is what the install
            below is for.
        Assuming the launcher is why a machine that already had Python
        was told it had none.
