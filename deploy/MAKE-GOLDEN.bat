@echo off
REM  MT5-Trader - build the MetaTrader 5 template. Double-click it.
REM
REM  Everything else in this folder is a .bat for a reason: typing
REM  .\deploy\make-golden-terminal.ps1 into a Command Prompt does not
REM  run it. cmd.exe cannot execute PowerShell, so Windows offers to
REM  OPEN the file instead - a "Select an app to open this .ps1 file"
REM  dialog offering Notepad - and nothing happens. This wrapper is the
REM  same script with that trap removed.
REM
REM  Prepare the source first, and it is three steps:
REM
REM    1. Install MetaTrader 5 with the BROKER'S installer into its own
REM       folder, C:\MT5-A by default.
REM    2. Do NOT log in. Cancel the Open an Account dialog.
REM    3. Close the terminal.
REM
REM  Everything else - Market Watch, charts, News, Allow Algo Trading -
REM  is kept in AppData, not the program folder, so it is not in this
REM  zip and cannot be prepared here.
REM
REM      MAKE-GOLDEN.BAT                 uses C:\MT5-A
REM      MAKE-GOLDEN.BAT D:\MT5-Source   uses that folder instead
REM
REM  Plain ASCII on purpose: a console running the default code page
REM  turns anything else into mojibake in the one message that matters.
