"""The launcher. One file, no arguments:

    py -3.11 start.py

It brings up everything: a leg runner per account, the coordinator, and
the web UI. Three things make it the only file anyone has to run.

**It starts the UI FIRST, even with nothing configured.** A fresh
install has no accounts, and the accounts are entered ON THE SCREEN —
credentials included, into `.env`, never into a file anyone edits by
hand. A launcher that exits with "no accounts configured" leaves the
operator with nowhere to enter them.

**It watches the config and restarts what changed.** Accounts, symbols
and the hedge ratio are read at startup by the runners and the
coordinator, so when the operator saves an account the engine has to
come back to see it. It does that itself, within a few seconds, and
says so — rather than making a restart the operator's job to remember.

**It never `terminate()`s a child that is running its own shutdown.**
The coordinator's shutdown sweeps pendings at both brokers; killing it
half way there leaves orders resting that nothing is watching.
