"""The algos, and the switch that says which one is running.

This system is a MANUAL ladder with an Algo beside it. The rule this
module is where it would be lost:

    Nothing places an order by itself — except a ladder's Algo in LIVE,
    which a person switched on and confirmed, today, and which then has
    that ladder to itself.

What follows DECIDES and says what it would do. **It does not place,
modify or cancel an order itself** — a test reads this file as code and
fails the build if it can reach a broker. What it decides leaves as an
INTENT — "enter, selling the spread", "exit position POS-12, profit
target" — handed to `algodesk`, which records it, and in LIVE hands it
to `algoexec`, the one module that sends.

One algo per ladder, and NONE by default:

**FAIR_SPREAD** — what the basis SHOULD be, on financing alone. It
first asks what kind of pair this is, because the answer changes the
arithmetic:

- *spot vs a future*: the future converges to the spot on ITS expiry,
  so the carry runs to that date;
- *future vs future* (a calendar): the near leg is the one that
  expires first and the spread is decided then, so the carry runs to
  the NEAR expiry;
- *two different instruments*: nothing forces them together and there
  is no fair value to quote. Saying so is the honest answer.

**ALGO** — Bollinger bands on the spread (`B - beta x A`, from the mid):

- *the band*: EMA(N) of the spread's candles, plus and minus
  `entry_z` x sigma (population, last N closes, the forming candle
  included). See `bands`.
- *entry*: SELL the spread when the z of the BID-side spread (what a
  sell receives) is at or above `+entry_z`; BUY when the z of the
  ASK-side spread (what a buy pays) is at or below `-entry_z`. It must
  hold for `confirm_ticks` fresh quotes in a row, and only on a ladder
  with no position open.
- *gates* hold an ENTRY back and say why: no price or a stale/jumping
  one, not enough candles, the cooldown after an exit, the last
  `cutoff_buffer_min` of the session, and a |z| already past
  `max_entry_z` (a blow-out, not a stretch). **A gate never holds back
  an exit.**
- *exit*, for each REAL position on the ladder, measured from its own
  fill: the closing side reaching break-even after every cost plus the
  take-profit (% of margin) — the same TP the Exit panel shows — or
  falling to the STOP LOSS, break-even minus `stop_loss_pct` of margin
  (on by default). Three more, each OFF unless the ladder turns it on:
  a z-stop, a z mean reversion taken only in profit, and a time stop in
  candles.

The switch is per ladder, held in memory, and OFF after every restart:
an algo nobody turned on today is an algo nobody is watching.
