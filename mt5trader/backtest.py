"""Replay history through the Algo: what it WOULD have done.

The same decision code the live Algo runs — `AlgoSignal` for the entry
and the exits, `judge_filters` for the filters, the same band — fed one
15-minute candle at a time from MT5's own bars. Nothing here can reach
an order: it takes numbers and returns a list of what it would have
traded, and a test keeps it that way.

What it cannot see, and says so in its result:

- **Inside a candle.** Each candle is one look at the spread, at its
  close: a stop touched and recovered within fifteen minutes is not seen,
  and an exit is taken at the close it was seen at.
- **The book.** The bid-ask is the width measured now, held constant.
- **Confirmation in ticks.** Live, an entry needs N fresh quotes in a
  row; here one candle close is one confirmation.
- **The warm-up and the live feed checks**, which are about the live
  tape, not about history.
