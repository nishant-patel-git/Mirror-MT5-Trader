"""LIMIT mode: quote one leg, cross the other — and hold closing levels.

TWO KINDS OF RESTING ORDER LIVE HERE, and they are not symmetric.

An ENTRY is backed by a REAL pending on one leg. A CLOSE is backed by
NOTHING at the broker: it is a level this module watches, and a close by
TICKET when the market reaches it.

That asymmetry is forced, not chosen. MT5 honours `position` on
TRADE_ACTION_DEAL and IGNORES it on TRADE_ACTION_PENDING, so a "closing"
limit rests as an ordinary limit — and on a hedging account an ordinary
opposite limit OPENS a second position. Live 2026-09-02: ticket 2092 was
rested to close ticket 2090 and filled as a BUY 0.01 beside the SELL
0.01 it was meant to close. This module believed that leg was flat,
closed the other leg on the strength of it, and the reconciler swept
both futures as orphans a minute later. Attaching a broker take-profit
to the leg instead is not the answer either: one leg closing alone
converts the hedge into a naked outright.

What holding the level here costs, said plainly because it is real: the
close only fires while this is running, and it crosses at the touch
rather than earning the level.

THE ENTRY PATH, which is what the rest of this file is about:

A synthetic working order is backed by a REAL pending limit on ONE leg
(the "quoting" leg). When that limit fills, the other leg is crossed at
market IMMEDIATELY. This earns one leg's bid-ask and pays the other's
instead of paying both, and it buys that edge by taking on legging risk.

The part that is easy to get wrong: **the quoting leg's price is not
fixed.** The trader clicked a SPREAD level, but the pending lives on a
LEG, and the price that produces the clicked spread depends on where
the other leg is right now:

    quoting B, SELL the spread at S:   P_B = S + beta * ask_A
    quoting B, BUY  the spread at S:   P_B = S + beta * bid_A
    quoting A, SELL the spread at S:   P_A = (bid_B - S) / beta   (buy A)
    quoting A, BUY  the spread at S:   P_A = (ask_B - S) / beta   (sell A)

So the pending is re-priced to hold the implied spread at the clicked
level — chasing the OTHER leg, for the order's whole life. In the
stat-arb system a peg anchored on its own leg's book chased the market
away from itself, never filled, timed out at 15s and crossed: 13.96
seconds from click to pair-on against 24ms for the market path, and
+0.4700 of slippage.

Three more rules, each of which has a test:

1. **Re-peg on a dead band, not on every tick.** Every MODIFY loses
   queue position; re-pricing three times a second guarantees you are
   never at the front of a queue, which defeats the entire point.
2. **Re-peg by MODIFY, never cancel-and-replace** — one ticket for the
   order's life. (MT5 cannot change a pending's VOLUME by MODIFY, so a
   RESIZE is the one case that must cancel and replace, and it says so.)
3. **Every MODIFY can race a fill.** Check for the fill BEFORE
   modifying, or you re-price an order that has already become a naked
   position.
