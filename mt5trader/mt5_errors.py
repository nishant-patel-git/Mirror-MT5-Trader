"""What MT5's own error codes mean, and what to actually do about them.

The Python package reports failures as `(code, description)` from
`mt5.last_error()`. The description is MT5's and is authoritative; what
it never supplies is the fix, and the codes are opaque enough that an
operator cannot get from "(-10001, 'IPC send failed')" to "your
terminal is running elevated and Python is not" without help.

Two callers share this table: `check_mt5.py` (the standalone checker)
and `mt5trader/diagnostics.py` (the Accounts page checklist). They used
to disagree — the checklist had ONE generic fix list for every terminal
failure, so a live -10001 with the terminal plainly open and logged in
told the operator to "Open the MT5 terminal" and "Log in". Advice that
describes something already done reads as the tool being broken.

Codes follow the RES_E_* constants the package exposes. The IPC family
(-10000..-10005) all mean the same class of thing — Python and the
terminal cannot talk — and on a machine where the terminal is visibly
running they almost always have the same handful of causes, so they
share a fix list ordered by how often each one is really it.
