"""The spread the ladder displays, built from two ticks.

    spread = P_B - beta * P_A

Leg B minus the hedge ratio times leg A, and nothing else. The hedge
ratio is the same number that sizes the hedge, so the spread is exactly
the P&L of the pair per unit — which is why beta is structural and
cannot change under an open position.

Ported from the stat-arb system's `marketdata.py`, with the strategy
machinery (z-scores, fair value) left behind. What is kept is every
rule that came out of a live loss: the mid comes from the BOOK, a level
is read on the EXECUTABLE side for its own direction, and a position
reads the opposite executable side to close.
