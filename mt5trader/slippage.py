"""The slippage report, over a real session.

Every number here is MEASURED. Nothing in this module simulates a fill,
back-fills a missing one with zero, or models what the spread "should"
have done: it reads the positions the engine actually opened and closed
in one session and reports what each one cost against the price that was
clicked.

Three rules, and each of them has cost money somewhere:

- **Unmeasured is not zero.** A position whose decision spread or whose
  fill could not be read has `entry_slippage = None`, and it stays None
  all the way to the screen, counted in its own column. Averaging it in
  as 0.00 flatters every number in the table and hides the one case
  worth looking at — the fill nobody could price.
- **Positive is a COST, at both ends.** `executor.slippage()` already
  flips the sign for exits; this module only ever adds. A report that
  reads an exit's cost as a gain is worse than no report.
- **A session is the BROKER's session.** The window runs from the last
  session cutoff on the broker's clock, because that is the day the
  fills are stamped in. On a machine hours away from the broker, a
  window cut on local midnight puts half of one session's fills in the
  other's.

Money is `points x spread_units x quantity` — `k`, the one multiplier
every spread-to-money conversion in this system uses (spec §2). The
report never invents a second one.
