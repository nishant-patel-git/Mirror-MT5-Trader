"""The Analysis tab: what the closed trades say, in numbers.

Ported from arrow-statarb's Analysis page and fitted to this desk —
money in the account currency, positions by ticket, a spread of
`Leg B - beta x Leg A`. Seven readings:

- **Summary**: trades, closed, net P&L, win rate.
- **Drawdown**: the equity curve's worst fall, and each trade's MAE
  (worst point against it) and MFE (best point for it).
- **Take / hold calibration**: where trades PEAKED, so the take-profit
  is set from measured peaks rather than opinion.
- **What-if-held shadow**: after an exit that was not a clean target,
  the position is marked on its own entry for an hour more — did the
  spread come back to break-even, or to the target? Often it did, and
  the exit was premature; or it did not, and the exit was right.
- **Z-score excursions**: how often the spread touches +-2 and +-3
  sigma on the Algo's own band, and how often a 2-sigma stretch comes
  all the way back to the mean.
- **Trade journal**: every round trip, entry to exit.
- (The backtest is the Algo's own, run from here.)

NOTHING HERE CAN REACH AN ORDER. It takes numbers and returns numbers;
a test keeps its imports to the standard library.

Unmeasured is not zero: a trade whose P&L or peak was never measured is
left out of the figure it would distort, and an empty set reads as a
dash, never 0.
