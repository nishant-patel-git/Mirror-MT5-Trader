"""Logs, on disk, for the morning after.

A trader reported that two legs of a live spread had been closed by
this system sixty seconds after they put them on. The reconciler said
so at CRITICAL, with the account, the ticket and the reason - into a
console window that had been closed. There was nothing on disk. The
incident could not be investigated, only reasoned about, and reasoning
about money is not good enough.

Every process writes here now: the launcher, the web server, the
coordinator and both leg runners, each to its own file so a leg's
chatter never buries a reconciler decision.

ROTATING, and small enough that a year of them is megabytes rather
than a full disk - a trading box that stops because a log filled the
volume is a worse fault than the one being logged.

APPEND, never truncate. The file survives a restart, which is exactly
the event most worth reading across.

The console keeps everything it had. This adds a second destination;
it takes nothing away, and a desk watching the black window sees what
it always did.
