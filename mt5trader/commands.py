"""The bridge between the web process and the coordinator.

The browser talks to a Flask process; the orders are placed by the
coordinator process, which is the only one holding the legs. Commands
cross that gap as append-only JSON lines, and results come back the
same way.

**The watermark is PRIMED at startup, and that is the whole point of
this module.** In the system this is ported from every watermark
initialised to 0, so on restart the engine replayed the ENTIRE history
of commands in half a second — opening an unintended live position and
placing real test orders. A command is not state: replaying "place this
order" is placing another order.

So: persistent STATE (which ladders exist, what is configured) lives in
the config; a COMMAND (place this, cancel that) is executed once, by
the process that was running when it was written, and never again.
