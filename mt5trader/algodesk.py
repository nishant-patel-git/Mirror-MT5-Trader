"""Where the Algo runs: one switch per ladder, its candles, its sink.

`algo.AlgoSignal` decides; `bands.SpreadCandles` measures; this module
feeds them on every poll and hands what they decide to a SINK.

**Two sinks, one seam.** Every intent — "enter, selling the spread",
"exit POS-12, profit target" — goes to `RecordingSink`: written to the
audit trail, kept for the screen, logged. In LIVE mode it ALSO goes to
the live sink (`algoexec.LiveSink`), which sends it: MARKET both legs
to enter, a close by TICKET to exit, through the same executor a
manual click uses. Nothing in this module can reach an order itself;
`tests/test_algo.py` reads it as code to keep it that way.

Rules this module keeps:

- **The switch is per ladder, in memory, and OFF at every start.** It
  is never written to the config: an algo nobody turned on today is an
  algo nobody is watching.
- **Algo or Manual, never both.** `manual_order_refusal` is what the
  click path consults: while a ladder's Algo is LIVE, a NEW manual
  order on it is refused in words. In DRY_RUN it refuses nothing. A
  close is never refused here — CLOSE ALL, flatten and closing a
  position by hand do not come through it.
- **The day's limits** — trades, a losing run, the money lost — stop
  ENTRIES for the rest of the broker's day and say which. Exits carry
  on whatever is hit.
- **History first, then the live tape.** Turning a ladder on loads its
  saved candles and asks MT5 for its bars, so the band is there at
  once. If the terminals will not answer — or a broker's clock is not
  measured, so a bar cannot be placed in time — the candles are built
  from the live mid instead and the screen says "collecting 7/20".
  Every candle that closes is saved, so a restart picks up where it
  left off.
