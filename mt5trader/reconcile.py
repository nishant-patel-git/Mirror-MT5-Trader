"""Assume you will lose track. Then find out, and say so.

Two ways our book and the broker's disagree:

- **Orphans** — a position at the broker that is not in our book. It is
  real money, unhedged as far as we know, and nobody is watching it.
- **Ghosts** — a position in our book that is not at the broker. It was
  closed by hand, stopped out, or never really existed.

Both are settled on THREE strikes, not one: a single poll can catch the
broker mid-fill, and acting on that is how a healthy position gets
closed for being briefly invisible.

Three rules that cost money in the system this is ported from:

1. **P&L on an orphan close multiplies by CONTRACT SIZE.** That was
   wrong for months and booked closes at 1% of what they cost — $0.81
   where the answer was $81.10. An unknown symbol gets 1.0 and SAYS SO.
2. **A close that did not go through leaves the position OPEN and
   ACTIVE.** Setting an ERROR/CLOSING status removes it from every
   active lookup — the ladder, the monitor, and this module's own
   known-ticket set — so the money sits at the broker while the UI
   reads flat.
3. **None is not empty.** A leg that could not be read is UNKNOWN, and
   an unknown account produces no orphans and no ghosts. Treating it as
   flat would turn every position we hold into a ghost and clear the
   book while the money is still out there.
