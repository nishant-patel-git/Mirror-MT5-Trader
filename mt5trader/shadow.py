"""The Algo, run on the live market with nothing to send to.

The signal journal used to carry its OWN copy of the Algo's rules - an
arm-then-enter machine written to "mirror" `algo.AlgoSignal`, and a
gate check written to "mirror" the filters. A mirror drifts, and every
place it drifted was a trade on the page the Algo would never take. On
a live desk, in one afternoon, the real Algo produced four signals, all
held back by its edge filter; the journal showed dozens, both ways, and
called most of them winners. The copy:

- read ONE z off the mid for both sides, where the Algo reads each
  side's own executable price - on a spread whose bid-ask was 2.4 sigma
  wide that put the copy's z 1.2 sigma ahead of the Algo's either way;
- skipped the edge filter whenever the Algo was ON;
- opened a new trade on every signal, where the Algo holds one;
- traded on a stale feed, which the Algo refuses;
- had no day's limit, no cooldown, no warm-up and no confirmation.

So there is no copy any more. This runs `algo.AlgoSignal` itself - the
class the live desk runs - fed the same market, the same gates and the
same filters (`algodesk.judge_filters`, which the backtest also uses),
and keeps its own day, warm-up and positions the way the desk keeps
them. What it decides is what the Algo would decide, because it IS the
Algo. Its positions are the journal's open rows; its intents are only
ever written down.

Nothing here can reach an order: it imports the Algo, the filters and
nothing else, and a test reads it as code to keep it that way.
