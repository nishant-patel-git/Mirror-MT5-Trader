"""One way to replace a file, and it has to work on Windows.

Every file this system publishes — the status snapshot, the command
results, the config — is written to a tmp file and then renamed over
the destination, so a reader never catches half a document.

On Windows that rename FAILS while any other process has the
destination open:

    PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied:
        'status.json.tmp' -> 'status.json'

The web process reads `status.json` several times a second, so the
collision is not rare — it is the normal case under load, and when it
hits, the coordinator's whole poll fails and the screen goes stale
while the market moves. (POSIX has no such rule: a rename over an open
file is always allowed there, which is why this only ever shows up on
the trading box.)

There are two halves to fixing that, and both are here.

The first is on the READING side, and it is the real one. Windows
blocks the rename because of the share mode the reader opened the file
with — Python's `open()` asks for read and write sharing but NOT
`FILE_SHARE_DELETE`, and a rename over a file counts as a delete of the
name. So every read of `status.json` by the web process holds the
coordinator's publish off for as long as the read takes. `read_text()`
opens with `FILE_SHARE_DELETE` as well, and the publish then goes
through underneath it: the reader keeps reading the bytes it already
had a handle to, which is exactly the isolation the tmp-file dance
wanted in the first place.

The second is to WAIT and try again, for the collisions that are not
ours — an antivirus scanner opening the file the moment it changes, a
sync client uploading it. Those hold it for far longer than a reader
does, and no share mode of ours affects them. What is not acceptable is
either alternative:

- writing straight over the destination, which is exactly the
  half-read this tmp-file dance exists to prevent;
- giving up and letting the poll fail, which is what was happening.

`replace()` returns True when the file was replaced and False when it
could not be, after trying — the caller decides whether that is worth
saying out loud. It never raises on the collision it is here for.
