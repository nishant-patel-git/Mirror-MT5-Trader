"""Configuration: accounts, pairs and settings in one JSON file.

Credentials never live in that file. Each account names an environment

`.env`, gitignored, written by the UI. Never in code, never in config,
never in chat, never in a log line.

Two things in here are load-bearing beyond "read some settings":

- **`save_raw` writes through a tmp file and `os.replace`.** A plain
  `open(path, 'w')` truncates, and a reader in that window sees half a
  config — which, in front of a read-modify-write save, wrote an EMPTY
  config back and deleted every account.
- **The clash refusals** (`endpoint_clash`, `login_clash`,
  `terminal_clash`) are checked at SAVE time, not only at startup. A
  refusal at save is a corrected field; a refusal at startup is five
  restart attempts with the reason scrolling past.
