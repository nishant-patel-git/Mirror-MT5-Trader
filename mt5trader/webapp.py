"""The web process: it renders, and it asks. It never trades.

The browser talks to this Flask app; the orders are placed by the
coordinator, which is the only process holding the legs. Everything the
UI shows comes from the coordinator's status snapshot, and everything
it does goes out as a command through `commands.py` — which is executed
once and never replayed.

Two rules from the spec shape the endpoints here:

- **Symbol setup must work with the coordinator DOWN.** Otherwise the
  system deadlocks: the coordinator will not start until the symbols
  are right, and these are the tools for finding out. So the symbol
  endpoints open a short-lived `RemoteLeg` straight to the account's
  runner.
- **Never send the operator to a log for a decision already made.** A
  refusal carries the broker's — or the config's — own words, in the
  response body, for the panel to print.
