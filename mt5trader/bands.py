"""Bollinger bands on the SPREAD: candles, an EMA middle, and sigma.

The Algo's whole statistical input, and nothing else. It is arithmetic
on numbers it is handed — it never reads a price, a broker or a clock
of its own, so the same code answers for a backfill from MT5's bars, a
restart from the database and a live tick, and a test can drive all
three.

The convention is TradingView's Bollinger with an EMA basis, because
that is the chart a trader checks it against:

- **candles** of `timeframe_sec`, each closing on the last spread seen
  in its bucket. The candle still FORMING counts: its close is the live
  mid spread, so the middle line and the band move with the market the
  way they do on a chart;
- **middle** = Pine's `ta.ema(close, N)`: seeded with the simple average
  of the first N closes, then `alpha = 2 / (N + 1)` over every close
  after it. The more history behind it, the closer it sits to the
  chart's own value, which is why more than N candles are kept;
- **sigma** = Pine's `ta.stdev(close, N)`: the POPULATION standard
  deviation of the last N closes, forming candle included.

**Unmeasured is not zero.** Fewer than N closes, or a flat series, is
not ready: `stats()` says how many it has and how many it needs, and
returns no mean and no sigma rather than a band drawn from nothing.
