"""The coordinator: two feeds in, one spread per pair out.

It is the only process that sees both accounts at once. Each poll it
reads a tick from each leg runner, fuses them into a spread per pair,
runs the guards, and publishes one status snapshot that the ladders,
the Market Grid and the positions monitor all render from — so a number
cannot disagree with itself between panels, and the grid costs no extra
MT5 round trips.

What it must not do: poll `account_info` on every pass (it is an IPC
round trip, cached ~5s), and lag the panel beside it. The achieved loop
interval is published so "is the engine or the browser slow?" is
answerable rather than guessed at.
