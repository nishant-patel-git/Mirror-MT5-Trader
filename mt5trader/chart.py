"""The pair chart's series: each ladder's spread and the Algo's z, as
CANDLES.

Observes only. Fed from the poll the signal journal already runs - the
Algo's OWN z, read off the same candles it trades on - so the chart is
the number the Algo decides on, not a second reckoning of it.
Arrow-statarb computed its chart z against the window's own mean; here
that would draw a z the Algo never saw.

Every poll goes into a 10-second candle - open, high, low, close of the
spread and of z - so a high or a low the poll saw is never thinned
away. The screen merges these into the candle size its range wants.

Written to a file of its own beside the status file, every couple of
seconds: the status file is read several times a second and carrying
two hours of candles in it would make every one of those reads heavy.
