"""The local database: crash-safe state, and the trade journal.

Two jobs, and they are different in kind:

- **State.** Open positions live here as well as in memory, so a restart
  recovers what is actually on at the broker. Without it the book comes
  back empty, the reconciler reads every real position as an orphan,
  and sixty seconds later it closes them. That is the machinery working
  correctly on a book that lied to it.
- **The journal.** Every FILL the broker reports, ours and the trader's
  own terminal clicks alike, keyed by MT5's deal id. It is the record
  that survives us: an audit trail we did not write from our own
  intentions, but read back from what actually happened.

Mechanics that were paid for in the system this is ported from:

- **WAL and a 30-second busy timeout, through ONE `_connect()`.** The
  web process reads this file while the coordinator writes it, and the
  default raises `database is locked` immediately — which once stopped
  an exit loop for 30 seconds with a live position open.
- **A deal is written once**, by `INSERT OR REPLACE` on the deal id.
  Deal history is re-read on every pass and the same fill arrives many
  times; a journal that grows a row per read is not a journal.
- **Broker time is stored beside our own.** MT5 stamps deals with the
  SERVER's wall clock encoded as an epoch, and reading that as an
  ordinary timestamp puts every row hours away from the same trade in
  MT5's own History — which is enough to make the two tables look like
  different accounts.
