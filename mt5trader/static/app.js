/* The ladder, the Market Grid and the positions monitor.
 *
 * Everything on screen comes from ONE snapshot (/api/status), which the
 * coordinator publishes each poll — so the ladder cannot disagree with
 * the grid beside it, and the grid costs no extra MT5 round trips.
 * Everything the trader does goes out as a command (/api/command) and
 * is executed once by the coordinator.
 *
 * House rules, from the spec:
 *   - No native confirm() / alert() / prompt(). One shared modal.
 *   - Errors do not auto-hide. A failure that vanishes in 3s is missed.
 *   - Unmeasured is not zero: render an em dash.
 *   - Never send the operator to a log for a decision already made.
