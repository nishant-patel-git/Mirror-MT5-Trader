"""The signal journal is the Algo's OWN decision, with the Algo on or off.

The fault these are written against was measured on a live desk. In
one afternoon the real Algo produced four signals, every one held back
by its edge filter - and the journal showed dozens of trades, both
ways, most of them "took profit". The journal ran its own COPY of the
Algo's rules, and the copy did not match:

1. it read ONE z off the mid for both sides, where the Algo reads each
   side's own executable price - on a spread whose bid-ask is wide
   against sigma, that put it well ahead of the Algo either way;
2. with the Algo ON it skipped the edge filter altogether;
3. it opened a new trade on every signal, where the Algo holds one;
4. it traded through a stale feed, which the Algo refuses;
5. it had no day's limit, no cooldown and no confirmation.

Every test here drives REAL PRICES through the real engine and reads
what the journal wrote. The decisive one runs the Algo LIVE, with real
fills on the test brokers, and asks the journal for exactly the trades
the desk took.

The prices are set by where they put the SELL side's executable spread
against the band: `ARM` stretches it past the entry z, `WINDOW` brings
it back inside the re-entry window, `HOME` takes it back through the
floor.
