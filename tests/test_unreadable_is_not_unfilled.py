""""I could not ask" must never be spent as "it has not filled".

The MetaTrader5 API answers None when it could not ask and an EMPTY
TUPLE when it asked and there was nothing. `or ()` collapsed the two,
so silence came back as a confident zero — a filled volume of 0.0 built
out of no information at all. Downstream that reads as "carry on", and
carrying on is the one answer that cannot be right about an order which
may already be on.

That is CLAUDE.md's rule in its most expensive form: None means
UNKNOWN, not "flat"; unmeasured is not zero. Here it is pinned at all
three layers the answer passes through — the broker that reads the
terminal, the leg that carries the answer over IPC, and the quoter that
acts on it — each with a control that supplies a real answer and
asserts the opposite.
