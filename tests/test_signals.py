"""Signals: the bookkeeping of the signal journal's rows.

WHAT IS NOT HERE ANY MORE, and why. This file used to test an
arm-then-enter machine and a stop-and-target check that lived in
`signals.py` as a copy of the Algo's rules. The copy did not match the
Algo - on a live desk it showed dozens of trades in an afternoon in
which the real Algo took none - and it is gone: what arms, what enters
and what exits is decided by the Algo's own code (`shadow.ShadowAlgo`,
tested in `test_signal_journal.py`), and its rules are tested where
they live, in `test_algo_signal.py`. What remains here is arithmetic on
rows: a refusal noted, a stretch settled, a trade marked and closed,
the tally and the journal.
