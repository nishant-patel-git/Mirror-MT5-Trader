"""Seventeen digits where the trader typed two.

`0.01 / 0.1` is `0.09999999999999999` in binary floating point, and a
LIMIT fill computes a position's size exactly that way — leg B's lots
divided by what one Qty is worth. Three 0.01 buys covered by three 0.01
sells is `-3.469446951953614e-18`, not zero.

Both reached the screen. The Net column printed the seventeen digits,
and the ladder footer printed the tiny one where it should have said
FLAT — because a number that small is still not zero to an `if`. The
trader who reported "sometimes 8.235121223000000... , sometimes
0.000000001122411, when 3-4 positions are open" was looking at this.

Nothing was wrong with any trade. The arithmetic was right and the
sweeping was missing. `sizing.tidy` is the convention this codebase
already uses for it — nine decimal places, which changes no quantity
anybody could type.
