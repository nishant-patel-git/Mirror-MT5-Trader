"""The fair-value algo — and the line an algo must not cross.

This system is a MANUAL ladder. Every rule it is built on says so, and
the rule that matters most here is the one an algo is most likely to
break: nothing places, modifies or cancels an order by itself.

So these tests are in two halves. The first says the arithmetic is
right — which KIND of pair this is, and therefore what its carry runs
to. The second says that whatever it concludes, NOTHING HAPPENS: no
order, no change to a click, no difference to the manual path at all.
