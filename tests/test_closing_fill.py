"""A resting CLOSE is synthetic, and what happens when it fires.

WHY IT IS SYNTHETIC, in one paragraph, because this is the thing that
cost real money:

A closing order cannot be a broker pending. MT5 honours `position` on
TRADE_ACTION_DEAL and IGNORES it on TRADE_ACTION_PENDING, so a "closing"
limit rests as an ordinary limit — and on a hedging account an ordinary
opposite limit OPENS a second position. Live 2026-09-02, ticket 2092 was
rested to close ticket 2090 and filled as a BUY 0.01 sitting beside the
SELL 0.01 it was meant to close. The engine believed that leg was flat,
closed the other leg on the strength of it, and the reconciler swept
both futures as orphans a minute later:

    15:34:55 CRITICAL reconcile: closed ORPHAN GCZ6.s ticket 2090 — SELL
    15:34:55 CRITICAL reconcile: closed ORPHAN GCZ6.s ticket 2092 — BUY

Attaching a broker take-profit to the leg instead is not the answer
either: one leg closing alone converts the hedge into a naked outright.

So the level is held HERE, and when the market reaches it the position
is closed BY TICKET on both legs at once. What that costs, stated
plainly and tested below: it only fires while this is running, and it
crosses at the touch rather than earning the level.

Every guard has a CONTROL that turns the condition off and asserts the
opposite, so none of them can pass by doing nothing.
