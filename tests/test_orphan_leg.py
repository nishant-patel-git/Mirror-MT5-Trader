"""The orphan leg: a click that put one leg on and reported a refusal.

Reported by two desks on 2026-09-09. Leg A executed, leg B was never
sent, and the position turned up in the reconciler as an unclaimed
ticket carrying our own comment - which nothing is allowed to close, so
there was no way off it from the screen.

ONE FAULT, IN THREE LAYERS:

  * `BrokerSession.send_market_order` compared the retcode against
    `TRADE_RETCODE_DONE` alone. MT5 answers 10010 DONE_PARTIAL when it
    fills PART of a market order, and a position is open for the part
    that filled. That was reported upwards as a flat failure, with no
    ticket and no volume.
  * `LocalLeg.order` zeroed `filled_volume` and `position_tickets`
    whenever the broker said no, so even a ticket that HAD come back
    was thrown away.
  * `PairExecutor.market_entry` read a failed FIRST leg as "nothing is
    on. This is a refusal, not a naked position", returned, and never
    sent the second leg or unwound the first.

Each layer is tested here with its control, because a guard that fires
either way is not a guard.
