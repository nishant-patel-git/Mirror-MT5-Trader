"""The terminal opens in a window of its own, not a browser tab.

The trader double-clicks an icon and the terminal is there. That is the
whole of the desktop story, and on a screen that sends live orders the
window is not merely tidier than a tab:

- a tab is closed by a stray ctrl-W aimed at the tab beside it;
- an extension in the trader's everyday profile — an ad blocker, a
  script injector, a password manager autofilling the wrong form — runs
  inside the page that sends orders, unless the window has a profile of
  its own;
- the tab strip and address bar are about 70px of vertical space, on a
  screen where rail height has been fought over all week.

Edge because it is on every Windows 10 and 11 machine: nothing extra
ships and there is no new build toolchain.
