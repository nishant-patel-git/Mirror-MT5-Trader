"""One line per click, in the log file, always.

A successful placement used to write NOTHING. The ladder showed it, so
nobody added a line — and then "which cell did he click, and was it
LIMIT or MARKET?" could only be answered by opening the database and
doing arithmetic on the recorded slippage. The trader who was told his
order had filled where he never clicked waited a day for that answer.

The line carries what was ASKED FOR — pair, side, mode, size, level —
and what came of it, on every path including a refusal. A refusal is
exactly the case where nothing else records the intent at all.
