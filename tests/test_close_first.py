"""A click the opposite way REDUCES before it opens.

Reported from the desk: click the red column to sell, then the blue
column to buy back, and the second click opened a SECOND position with
a new ticket instead of closing the first. Both stayed live, both paid
carry, and the ticket count was not what anyone expected.

That is MT5 hedging mode doing exactly what it does: an opposite order
always opens a second position, and the broker will never net for us.
So the netting is done here, by closing tickets OLDEST FIRST.

Two places can create a position, and both go through the same
`book.reduce_first`: a MARKET click closes before it opens, and a
resting LIMIT order closes when it FILLS — because until the price the
trader named actually trades, there is nothing to close against.
