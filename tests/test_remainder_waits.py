"""A reducing click is ONE instruction, and the remainder goes LAST.

Live 2026-09-03, from the desk's own tickets:

    05:48  SELL 10 spread   A 2110 / B 2109   (MARKET)
    06:27  click BUY 12 at one level, in LIMIT mode
    06:27  BUY 2 spread OPENED   A 2127 / B 2126
           ...and SELL 10 still on.

The reduce arithmetic was right — 12 covers the 10, remainder 2, and
2 is exactly what opened. What was wrong is that the two halves of one
click ran on DIFFERENT ENGINES:

  - the remainder rested as an ordinary pending AT THE BROKER, and
    filled on the broker's own tick stream;
  - the close was a level watched HERE, at poll rate, about three
    times a second.

The broker's fills do not wait for our polling. The pending filled on a
tick we never sampled, the close did not fire, and the trader ended up
+2 AND still -10 — the one net position they certainly did not ask for.

So the remainder now rides on the close and opens only after it.
