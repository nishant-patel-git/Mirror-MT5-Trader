"""An unexplained position that explains itself must stop warning.

The reconciler is right to refuse to close a position carrying our own
comment that the book does not hold: the book is wrong, and closing a
real trade to tidy up a bookkeeping error is the worst outcome there
is. So it lists it for a person.

What it never did was TAKE THE NOTICE BACK DOWN.

And the gap it fires in is not an edge case — it is the ordinary life
of a resting order. The broker fills a pending on ITS clock. We see it
on the next poll and book the pair a moment after that. A reconcile
pass landing in between sees a leg it cannot explain yet. One entirely
normal second therefore left a PERMANENT false alarm against a healthy,
hedged position — with "Close it" as the only button offered, which
would have left the other leg naked.

A warning nobody can clear is a warning everybody learns to ignore,
and the day it means something nobody looks.
