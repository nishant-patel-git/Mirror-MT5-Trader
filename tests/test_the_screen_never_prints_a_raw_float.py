"""No size reaches the screen without being swept.

`0.01 / 0.1` is 0.09999999999999999, and three 0.01 buys covered by
three 0.01 sells is -3.469446951953614e-18. The engine sweeps both now
— but the screen is where a trader meets a number, and `app.js` has a
`qty()` helper whose own comment says it exists so that "nothing on the
way to the screen can put the dust back".

Seven places were not using it, which is how the trader came to see
seventeen digits where they had typed two.

This is a SOURCE check on purpose. Driving a browser to prove it means
a shared page, a live poll and a random test order — I wrote three such
tests and they took three unrelated ones down with them. A regression
here would be reintroduced by someone typing `+ row.net_position +`,
and that is exactly what this reads.
