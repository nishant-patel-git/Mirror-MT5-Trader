"""The screen lock, and the PIN that opens it.

Two things a desk asked for and one mechanism underneath: a trader who
left for the day with a live account on screen, and a stray click on a
ladder.

Every refusal below is paired with a CONTROL that turns the same guard
off and asserts the opposite. A lock that refuses everything is not a
lock, it is an outage.
