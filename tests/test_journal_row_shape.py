"""What the journal writes, checked against the REAL producer.

The commission and swap columns were NULL on every fill ever written,
on every account, because `BrokerSession.order_log()` merged the
broker's two figures into one `fee` and never emitted them separately —
while `Store.record_fills` read `row.get('commission')` and
`row.get('swap')`.

FOUR LAYERS SAID THOSE COLUMNS WERE MEANT TO BE FILLED: the schema, the
insert, the Fills table's own Comm/Swap columns, and a test asserting
`fill['commission'] < 0` — "the broker's, not ours". Only the producer
disagreed.

IT WENT UNCAUGHT BECAUSE THE DOUBLE WAS RICHER THAN THE REAL THING.
`FakeBroker._record_deal` emitted commission, swap and magic; the real
`order_log` emitted none of them. Every test of the journal ran against
the fake, asserted the broker's commission was there, and passed. A
double that supplies what production does not cannot fail the way
production does — and it manufactures confidence, which is worse than
an outright gap.

So the tests here drive the REAL `order_log` against a fake MT5 module,
and pin the two producers' key sets equal so the double can never drift
richer again.

Why it costs money: the engine marks P&L with the TYPED
`COMMISSION_PER_LOT_A/B`, which default to 0.0. The journal is the
counterweight that catches a commission nobody entered. With the
counterweight stuck at zero, both numbers agree at $0.00 and
EXIT_IF_PROFIT closes a position still under water by the commission.
