"""Lock means LOCKED: the engine holds the window, not just the scroll.

The Lock tick used to stop the BROWSER recentring its scroll while the
two things that actually move a price off its row — the anchor, and the
window widening to follow the touches — carried on underneath it. A
control named Lock that locks a third of the movement is worse than no
control, because the trader believes the ladder is still and aims a
click at a row that is about to become a different price.

Every test here has a CONTROL that turns the lock off and asserts the
opposite, so none of them can pass against a ladder that never moves
for some other reason.
