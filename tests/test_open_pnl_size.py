"""Size is in `spread_units` once, and must not be charged twice.

Reported from the desk with the screen beside MT5:

    Net  10  entry 45.6300  mark 46.1800  ->  -$55.00   (should be -$5.50)
    Net 100  entry 45.5800  mark 46.1800  -> -$6,000.00 (should be -$60.00)
    our total -$6,055.00      MT5's own -$56.70

`SpreadPosition.mark` returned `move * spread_units * quantity`. But
every place a position is built passes `spread_units(leg_b.volume,
contract_b)`, and `leg_b.volume` is the volume of the WHOLE position —
1.0 lots for 100 spreads, not the 0.01 one spread costs. The size was
already in there.

WHY IT SURVIVED EVERYTHING: at Qty 1 the double count is x1.
`spread_units` is 0.01 x 100 = 1.0, `quantity` is 1, and the wrong
formula gives the right answer. Every check made on this system, mine
included, was made at Qty 1.

So every test here uses a size GREATER THAN ONE.
