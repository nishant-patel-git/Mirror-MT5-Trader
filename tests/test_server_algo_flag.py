"""The broker's own algo switch, which is not the button on the toolbar.

Two different switches answer with two different codes, and only one of
them can be fixed from this machine:

    10027  AutoTrading disabled by CLIENT  — the toolbar button
    10026  AutoTrading disabled by SERVER  — the broker, per account

The second was READ from MT5 (`account_info().trade_expert`) and never
checked. So a freshly opened account connected, reported its balance,
quoted happily, passed every startup check — and then refused the first
LIVE order with 10026. Finding that out by clicking on a real ladder is
the worst possible moment.
