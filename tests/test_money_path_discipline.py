"""Rules about the money paths, checked mechanically rather than by eye.

Three separate bugs in this codebase were the SAME bug: a call that
says whether money moved, whose answer was thrown away.

  * The executor unwound a half-filled pair and ignored both answers,
    so a leg that would not come off left the trader naked with the
    screen showing a refusal.
  * The quoter did the same after a rejected hedge - on the RESTING
    order path, where the fill happens with nobody watching.
  * The session cutoff counted DAY orders it had ASKED to cancel, so a
    cancel that failed was published as one that worked, and an order
    left resting overnight was recorded as pulled.

Every one was found by reading code carefully, twice, after a trader
lost money. Reading carefully does not scale and I have already proved
it does not: fixes of mine introduced further bugs three times in this
project.

So the rule is enforced by a parser instead. This file is the method,
not a test of a feature.
