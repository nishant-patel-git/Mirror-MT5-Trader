"""An optional suite must SKIP on a desk, never ERROR.

`pytest tests/ -q` is the gate START-TRADING and UPDATE.BAT run before
they will let a machine trade. The browser suites are optional - a
trading desk has no browser and does not need one - so anything that
stops them importing has to end in a skip. An error there fails the
gate, and UPDATE.BAT then rolls a good version back off the machine.

That is not hypothetical. On a locked-down desk Windows Application
Control blocked `_greenlet.pyd`, which playwright imports:

    ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _greenlet:
    An Application Control policy has blocked this file.

`pytest.importorskip` did not catch it. Since pytest 9.1 it defaults to
ModuleNotFoundError only, and requirements.txt asks for
`pytest>=8.0.0` - so a desk installed that day got 9.1 and the new
behaviour without anyone choosing it. Collection errored, the gate
failed, and a machine that was perfectly able to trade was put back on
the previous version.

This runs pytest in a subprocess against a playwright that raises
exactly that ImportError, and requires a clean exit.
