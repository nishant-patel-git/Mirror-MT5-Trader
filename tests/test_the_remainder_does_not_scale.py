"""A reducing click bigger than the position it covers.

BUY 12 over a SELL 10 is ONE instruction: cover the 10, then open 2.
The 2 is held here (`QuoteGroup.open_after`) and opens only once the
close has actually gone through — resting it at the same moment gave it
a different engine from the close, and live 2026-09-03 that left a
trader +2 AND still -10.

The question this file answers is whether the 2 should SHRINK when the
close only goes through in part. It should not, and that is the point
being pinned: the click named an absolute size, not a proportion of
somebody else's fill. A trader who asked to end up long 2 wants to end
up long 2, whether the cover took one pass or four.

What the review did find is the other half: the paths that DROP the
remainder. Dropping it is right — something else covered the position,
so the rest is no longer the trade that was asked for — but one of the
two paths said so and the other did it in silence.
