"""Our open P&L against MT5's own — compared as of ONE moment.

The Positions monitor shows both totals and the gap, and reddens the
row when they disagree by more than a cent. A disagreement means one of
us is wrong about real money, so it must be shown.

But the two halves were read on different clocks. Our marks come off
the tick the poll just read; `account_info` is cached for ~5 seconds.
The row therefore compared a photo taken now against one taken five
seconds ago, and on a moving market they ALWAYS differed by more than a
cent — a desk reported $28.00 in red with nothing actually wrong. A
light that is always on is a light nobody reads, and the day it means
something nobody looks.

The answer is NOT a bigger tolerance. A dollar figure for "market
noise" would be wrong the moment a pair with a different `k` is added —
oil at 1,000/lot drifts ten times faster than gold at 100/lot for the
same tick — and nobody has a sound basis for picking one. Instead the
comparison is only taken on the passes where BOTH halves were read
together, and held between them.
