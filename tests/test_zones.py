"""The hypothetical levels a signal would have been given.

The sigma ZONE track these tests were written for is gone - it wrote
16,562 rows on a live desk in one day and nobody read them. What is
left is the arithmetic the signals need, and it still has to be right:
a long recovers its costs UP and a short DOWN, and a level that could
not be priced is None rather than zero.
