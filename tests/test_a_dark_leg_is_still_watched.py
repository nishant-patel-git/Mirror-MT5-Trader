"""NO PRICE IS NOT NOTHING TO DO.

2026-09-16, live: a trader's leg filled at 18:47:12 and was hedged at
19:00:03. Twelve minutes and fifty-one seconds naked, in silence, on a
pair whose orders the system was supposedly working.

Nothing was broken at the broker. The pending was a real order and the
broker filled it exactly as asked. What failed was here: one leg's tick
went missing, the coordinator's poll said

    if not tick_a or not tick_b:
        continue

and that `continue` skipped EVERYTHING below it — including the only
call that asks whether a resting order has filled. The instant a tick
came back, the fill was noticed and hedged in one second.

So the rule this file pins is a single sentence: a price we cannot see
is a reason to stop PLACING and the opposite of a reason to stop
WATCHING. A pending is a real order at a real broker and it fills
whether or not this process can price it.

Every guard here has a CONTROL that turns the darkness off and asserts
the opposite, because a test that only ever sees the dark path cannot
tell "withheld correctly" from "never worked at all".
