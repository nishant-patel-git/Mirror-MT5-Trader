"""A resting close takes the PIECE the click reached, not the ticket.

THE INCIDENT. A trader held a 0.10 spread from the previous day and
clicked the ladder the opposite way for 0.01, in LIMIT, to take a
little off. `positions_to_reduce` picked the oldest ticket and sized
the piece at 0.01, `arm` recorded 0.01 on the synthetic — and when the
market reached the level, the quoter closed the position with no
quantity at all, which means ALL of it. The whole 0.10 went, at a
price chosen for a 0.01 trade, and the 0.01 they meant to close was
still open afterwards.

It reached both modes, because both rest through the quoter: LIMIT at
any level, and MARKET clicked away from the touch. A MARKET click AT
the touch was always right — that path goes through `reduce_first`,
which has passed its `take` since the day it was written — which is
why every existing test passed.

The controls matter as much as the tests here: a fix that closed only
ever a part would break CLOSE ALL, AutoRouting's target and a click
made deliberately at full size, and each of those is somebody's exit.
