"""The implied spread book.

A spread has no order book of its own; it has two, and the size at any
spread level is what the WORSE of the two legs can fill at the prices
that level implies. Every test here exists because the alternative — one
leg's size, or the sum of every combination — is a number a trader would
click on and not get.
