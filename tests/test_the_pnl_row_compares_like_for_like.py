"""MT5's own profit carries no commission. Ours did.

The monitor's reconciliation row puts our open P&L beside MT5's and
reddens on a difference. Ours was the NET figure - commission for both
ends of both legs already taken off - and MT5's `profit` is the
floating P&L on the two prices and nothing else.

So the difference carried a whole round trip's commission as a
permanent, structural gap that no market could ever close: a light
that is always on, which is a light nobody reads, and the day it means
something nobody looks.

It was invisible only because these accounts are billed at $0.00 a
lot. A number that is right only while a setting is zero is not right,
and that setting changes the day the desk moves broker.

Nothing the trader is SHOWN changes. `mark_fees` still charges both
ends, which is what a trade's P&L means and what keeps an open
position's figure continuous with the realised one when it closes.
Only the comparison changed - and the row now says which number it
used.
