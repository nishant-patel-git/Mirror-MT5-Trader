"""Logs on disk, for the morning after.

A trader reported that two legs of a live spread had been closed by
this system sixty seconds after they put them on. The reconciler said
so at CRITICAL, with the account, the ticket and the reason - into a
console window that had been closed. There was nothing on disk, so the
incident could not be investigated, only reasoned about.

Reasoning about money is not good enough. Every process writes to
logs/ now.
