"""How long was one leg alone? On the BROKER's clock, not on ours.

After the 2026-09-16 incident the report said the hedge took one
second. It had: one second from the moment this process NOTICED the
fill. The fill itself was twelve minutes and fifty-one seconds earlier,
and the number that would have shown that did not exist.

A report timed from when we looked cannot see a window created by
looking late. So the fill time now comes from the broker's own stamp on
the deal — and because MT5 stamps deals with the SERVER's wall clock,
the measured offset has to come off it first, or the subtraction is
between two time zones and reads in hours.

Unmeasured stays None and renders as a dash. A naked window shown as
0ms is the report telling the desk that nothing happened.
