"""'Nothing of ours is there' and 'we closed it' are both zero.

`close_tickets` reported `left: 0` for both, and `left` was the only
thing the callers could see. Two of them believe it about real money:

  - `_closed_fraction` books the position as FULLY CLOSED on it, and
  - `_unwind_what_went_on` reports "nothing naked" on it.

Both readings are right when the tickets really are gone — something
closed them first, and that is ordinary. Both are catastrophic when the
answer came from ONE bad read: a live leg struck off our own books
while the money sits at the broker, with nothing watching it.

So the absence is read TWICE before it is believed, `found` comes back
so a caller can tell the two apart at all, and an absence that survives
both reads is said out loud in the log.
